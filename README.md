# **README Generator**

  ## **Description**
  - Based on your answers to the prompts that show when you invoke 'node index.js' in the terminal, this application will provide a professional README.
  - There isn't a need to go back and fourth through tabs trying to remember what a README needs to include. This application can be used to generate a README for any project.
  - This application taught me a lot more about inquirers and the imaginative customizable outcomes you can invoke through this system.
